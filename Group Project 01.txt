# Question 1: Write a program to accept user input, convert into an integer and check whether it is a leap year
# Question 2: Write a program to call a function (def) to to find the sum of elements in an array using a 'for' loop using value and index (2 methods)
# Question 3: Write a program to accept user input, convert into an integer find the factorial using both 'for' and 'while' loops in the same program. (2 methods)
#             The program should continue to promt the user for a new number and print the factorial output until the user hits a vulae of 0, 
#             in which case the program should exit the while loop and terminate execution.
